# LEAPS2021_workshop
Python programming workshop for the LEAPS/ASPIRE 2021 programme. There are four topics available!

### 1 - Using GitHub
An introduction to the fundamentals of using GitHub, including this repository! A hands-on guide to setting up a GitHub workflow.

### 2 - Useful Tools
A whirlwind tour past some fundamental Python tools used in astronomy. A quick read, with links to lots of further examples.

### 3 - Collaborative GitHub
A group-based collaboration activity to go through the motions of forking, setting up a pull request, unit testing, and code review.

### 4 - Bayesian Tools in Python
A quick fitting example using PyMC3 and Stan. Prior knowledge of Bayesian statistics useful.

## Jupyter Notebooks

In order to work with this many of these tutorials on your computer, you're going to have to install Jupyter Notebooks, if you haven't done so already. Jupyter Notebook comes pre-packaged with Anaconda, if you have that installed. To open Jupyter Notebook, you just type:

```
jupyter notebook &
```

in commandline. This opens a Jupyter Notebook in a browser terminal (although it's not online, it just uses a browser to work). If you don't use Anaconda (and don't have Jupyter installed), you can do so as follows:

```
pip3 install --upgrade pip
pip3 install jupyter
```
